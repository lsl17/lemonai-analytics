# üçã Lemon AI Python Client

## About

**Lemon AI analytics tool to build powerful AI assistants in minutes and execute highly efficient workflow automations by accessing tools like Airtable, Hubspot, Slack and Github.**

Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions.

With Lemon AI, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for more reliable read-and-write operations. In addition, Lemon AI functions allow you to reduce the risk of hallucinations even more by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of insecurity.

## üìà Getting Started

The included .html page allows you to visualize how your LLM agents are using tools to solve a given task. To get started just open the corresponding html page in your browser and select the lemonai.log file that you want to visualize. As a result, you will be able to understand how frequently and in which workflow combination your tools are used:
